Commentions is a drop-in package for Filament that allows you to add comments to your resources. You can configure it so your users are mentionable in the comments, and it dispatches events so you can handle mentions in your own application however you like.

## Installation

```bash
composer require kirschbaum-development/commentions
```

## Usage

1. Publish the migrations

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="commentions-migrations"
```

2. In your `User` model implement the `Commenter` interface.

```php
use Kirschbaum\Commentions\Contracts\Commenter;

class User extends Model implements Commenter
{
    // ...
}
```

3. In the model you want to add comments, implement the `Commentable` interface and the `HasComments` trait.

```php
use Kirschbaum\Commentions\HasComments;
use Kirschbaum\Commentions\Contracts\Commentable;

class Project extends Model implements Commentable
{
    use HasComments;
}
```

### Usage with Filament

You can register the plugin in your Panel(s) like so:

```php
use Kirschbaum\Commentions\CommentionsPlugin;

return $panel
    ->plugins([
        CommentionsPlugin::make(),
    ])
```

There are a couple of ways to use Commentions with Filament.

1. Register the component in your Filament Infolists:

```php
Infolists\Components\Section::make('Comments')
    ->schema([
        CommentsEntry::make('comments')
            ->mentionables(fn (Model $record) => User::all()),
    ]),
```

2. Or in your table actions:

```php
use Kirschbaum\Commentions\Filament\Actions\CommentsTableAction;

->actions([
    CommentsTableAction::make()
        ->mentionables(User::all())
])
```

3. Or as a header action:

```php
use Kirschbaum\Commentions\Filament\Actions\CommentsAction;

protected function getHeaderActions(): array
{
    return [
        CommentsAction::make(),
    ];
}
```

***

### Configuring the User model and the mentionables

If your `User` model lives in a different namespace than `App\Models\User`, you can configure it in `config/commentions.php`:

```php
    'commenter' => [
        'model' => \App\Domains\Users\User::class,
    ],
```

### Configuring the Comment model

If you need to customize the Comment model, you can extend the `\Kirschbaum\Commentions\Comment` class and then update the `comment.model` option in your `config/commentions.php` file:

```php
    'comment' => [
        'model' => \App\Models\Comment::class,
        // ...
    ],
```

### Configuring Comment permissions

By default, users can create comments, as well as edit and delete their own comments. You can adjust these permissions by implementing your own policy:

#### 1) Create a custom policy

```php
namespace App\Policies;

use Kirschbaum\Commentions\Comment;
use Kirschbaum\Commentions\Contracts\Commenter;
use Kirschbaum\Commentions\Policies\CommentPolicy;

class CommentPolicy extends CommentPolicy
{
    public function create(Commenter $user): bool
    {
        // TODO: Implement custom permission logic.
    }

    public function update($user, Comment $comment): bool
    {
        // TODO: Implement custom permission logic.
    }

    public function delete($user, Comment $comment): bool
    {
        // TODO: Implement custom permission logic.
    }
}
```

#### 2) Register your policy in the configuration file

Update the `comment.policy` option in your `config/commentions.php` file:

```php
    'comment' => [
        // ...
        'policy' => \App\Policies\CommentPolicy::class,
    ],
```

### Configuring the Commenter name

By default, the `name` property will be used to render the mention names. You can customize it either by implementing the Filament `HasName` interface OR by implementing the optional `getCommenterName` method.

```php
use Filament\Models\Contracts\HasName;
use Kirschbaum\Commentions\Contracts\Commenter;

class User extends Model implements Commenter, HasName
{
    public function getFilamentName(): string
    {
        return (string) '#' . $this->id . ' - ' . $this->name;
    }
}
```

```php
use Kirschbaum\Commentions\Contracts\Commenter;

class User extends Model implements Commenter
{
    public function getCommenterName(): string
    {
        return (string) '#' . $this->id . ' - ' . $this->name;
    }
}
```

### Configuring the Commenter avatar

To configure the avatar, make sure your User model implements Filament's `HasAvatar` interface.

```php
use Filament\Models\Contracts\HasAvatar;

class User extends Authenticatable implements Commenter, HasName, HasAvatar
{
    public function getFilamentAvatarUrl(): ?string
    {
        return $this->avatar_url;
    }
}
```

### Events

Two events are dispatched when a comment is created or reacted to:

- `Kirschbaum\Commentions\Events\UserWasMentionedEvent`
- `Kirschbaum\Commentions\Events\CommentWasReactedEvent`

### Sending notifications when a user is mentioned

Every time a user is mentioned, the `Kirschbaum\Commentions\Events\UserWasMentionedEvent` is dispatched. You can listen to this event and send notifications to the mentioned user.

Example usage:

```php
namespace App\Listeners;

use Illuminate\Queue\InteractsWithQueue;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;
use App\Notifications\UserMentionedInCommentNotification;
use Kirschbaum\Commentions\Events\UserWasMentionedEvent;

class SendUserMentionedNotification implements ShouldQueue
{
    use InteractsWithQueue;

    public function handle(UserWasMentionedEvent $event): void
    {
        $event->user->notify(
            new UserMentionedInCommentNotification($event->comment)
        );
    }
}
```

If you have [event auto-discovery](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/events#registering-events-and-listeners), this should be enough. Otherwise, make sure to register your listener on the `EventServiceProvider`.

### Resolving the authenticated user

By default, when a new comment is made, the `Commenter` is automatically set to the current user logged in user (`auth()->user()`). If you want to change this behavior, you can implement your own resolver:

```php
use Kirschbaum\Commentions\Config;

Config::resolveAuthenticatedUserUsing(
    fn () => auth()->guard('my-guard')->user()
)
```

### Getting the mentioned Commenters from an existing comment

```php
$comment->getMentioned()->each(function (Commenter $commenter) {
    // do something with $commenter...
});
```

### Polling for new comments

Commentions supports polling for new comments. You can enable it on any component by calling the `pollingInterval` method and passing the number of seconds.

```php
Infolists\Components\Section::make('Comments')
    ->schema([
        CommentsEntry::make('comments')
            ->pollingInterval(10)
    ]),
```

### Rendering non-Comments in the list

Sometimes you might want to render non-Comments in the list of comments. For example, you might want to render when the status of a project is changed. For this, you can override the `getComments` method in your model, and return instances of the `Kirschbaum\Commentions\RenderableComment` data object.

```php
use Kirschbaum\Commentions\RenderableComment;

public function getComments(): Collection
{
    $statusHistory = $this->statusHistory()->get()->map(fn (StatusHistory $statusHistory) => new RenderableComment(
        id: $statusHistory->id,
        authorName: $statusHistory->user->name,
        body: sprintf('Status changed from %s to %s', $statusHistory->old_status, $statusHistory->new_status),
        createdAt: $statusHistory->created_at,
    ));

    $comments = $this->comments()->latest()->with('author')->get();

    return $statusHistory->merge($comments);
}
```

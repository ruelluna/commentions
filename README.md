# Commentions

Commentions is a drop-in package for Filament that allows you to add comments to your resources. You can configure it so your users are mentionable in the comments, and it dispatches events so you can handle mentions in your own application however you like.

## Installation

```bash
composer require kirschbaum-development/commentions
```

## Usage

1. Publish the migrations

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="commentions-migrations"
```

2. In your `User` model implement the `Commenter` interface.

```php
use Kirschbaum\Commentions\Contracts\Commenter;

class User extends Model implements Commenter
{
    // ...
}
```

3. In the model you want to add comments, implement the `Commentable` interface and the `HasComments` trait.

```php
use Kirschbaum\Commentions\HasComments;
use Kirschbaum\Commentions\Contracts\Commentable;

class Project extends Model implements Commentable
{
    use HasComments;
}
```

### Usage with Filament

1. And register the component in your Filament Infolists:

```php
Infolists\Components\Section::make('Comments')
    ->schema([
        Livewire::make(Comments::class, [
            'mentionables' => User::all(),
        ])
    ]),
```

2. Or in your table actions:

```php
use Kirschbaum\Commentions\Filament\Actions\CommentsTableAction;

->actions([
    CommentsTableAction::make()
        ->mentionables(User::all())
])
```

3. Or as a header action:

```php
use Kirschbaum\Commentions\Filament\Actions\CommentsAction;

protected function getHeaderActions(): array
{
    return [
        CommentsAction::make(),
    ];
}
```

And that's it!

### Configuring the User model and the mentionables

If your `User` model lives in a different namespace than `App\Models\User`, you can configure it in the `config/commentions.php` file:

```php
    'commenter' => [
        'model' => \App\Domains\Users\User::class,
    ],
```

By default, the `name` property will be used to render the mention names. You can customize it either by implementing the Filament `HasName` interface OR by implementing the optional `getCommenterName` method.

```php
use Filament\Models\Contracts\HasName;
use Kirschbaum\Commentions\Contracts\Commenter;

class User extends Model implements Commenter, HasName
{
    public function getFilamentName(): string
    {
        return (string) '#' . $this->id . ' - ' . $this->name;
    }
}
```

```php
use Kirschbaum\Commentions\Contracts\Commenter;

class User extends Model implements Commenter
{
    public function getCommenterName(): string
    {
        return (string) '#' . $this->id . ' - ' . $this->name;
    }
}
```

### Sending notifications when a user is mentioned

Every time a user is mentioned, the `Kirschbaum\Commentions\Events\UserWasMentionedEvent` is dispatched. You can listen to this event and send notifications to the mentioned user.

Example usage: 

```php
namespace App\Listeners;

use Illuminate\Queue\InteractsWithQueue;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;
use App\Notifications\UserMentionedInCommentNotification;
use Kirschbaum\Commentions\Events\UserWasMentionedEvent;

class SendUserMentionedNotification implements ShouldQueue
{
    use InteractsWithQueue;

    public function handle(UserWasMentionedEvent $event): void
    {
        $event->user->notify(
            new UserMentionedInCommentNotification($event->comment)
        );
    }
}
```

If you have [event auto-discovery](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/events#registering-events-and-listeners), this should be enough. Otherwise, make sure to register your listener on the `EventServiceProvider`.

### Resolving the authenticated user

By default, when a new comment is made, the `Commenter` is automatically set to the current user logged in user (`auth()->user()`). If you want to change this behavior, you can implement your own resolver:

```php
use Kirschbaum\Commentions\Config;

Config::resolveAuthenticatedUserUsing(
    fn () => auth()->guard('my-guard')->user()
)
```

### Getting the mentioned Commenters from an existing comment

```php
$comment->getMentioned()->each(function (Commenter $commenter) {
    // do something with $commenter...
});
```
